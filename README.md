# Attestation Client Suite

Current production tag is 1.1.0

The Attestation Client Suite is a set of software modules for handling tasks related to performing attestations in Flare's State Connector protocol. It includes the following modules:

- Attestation client
- Chain indexers (BTC, LTC, DOGE, XRP, ALGO)
- Auxiliary development tools (ctail, spammers, monitoring tools, ...)

The project depends heavily on the [Multi Chain Client library (MCC)](https://github.com/flare-foundation/multi-chain-client) that provides a unified interface to multiple blockchain APIs.
