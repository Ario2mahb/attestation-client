# Web server

The web server based on `express` library augumented with the library `tsoa`. 
It is used for serving attestation client results, which include the attestation for each round that the attestation provider voted for.
The server uses attestation client's database. The results can be used by entities wanting to construct attestation proofs.

From the security point of view, it is important that the server does not disclose the round voting results (attestations)
In addition to providing round voting results the server also serves the monitoring tool data (alerts system, this is optional)

There are two folders on the toplevel of the project used by this subproject:
- `static` - used to server static files, in particular `swagger.json` (OpenAPI 3 specification, autogenerated by `tsoa` library)
- `routes` - autogenerated by `tsoa` library
